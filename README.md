# maracuya-grapevine-TDA
Repository accompanying the paper "Visualizing slowly evolving ontogenetic and heteroblastic effects embedded in the leaves of grapevine and maracuy√° using topological data analysis"

Full code for the paper will be available here on 7/24.

For now, you can replicate the maracuy'{a} analysis by running the code from [this github](https://github.com/sperciva/giotto-mapper-pie-nodes). This code is not clean nor well commented, so while you wait, you may just want to play around with the Mapper graph [here](https://sperciva.github.io/giotto-mapper-pie-nodes/).
